    <h3>Athletics</h3>
    <article id="post">
        <p>In my early years of life, my dad introduced me to sports as early as I can remember. I grew up loving every sport and was busy playing them during all 4 seasons of year. I played basketball, soccer, football and baseball. I played all these sports up until highschool, where I decided to focus on one basketball. I played this sport during the fall, winter and spring because I played highschool and AAU basketball when I played for my team Swarm. My primary position was guard because I was considered undersized for the sport. I was in love with basketball and couldn't get enough of it. During my junior year this love came to an end, I didn't play very much do to my size and my coaches. This made me fall out of love and I realized I only liked playing it when it was with my friends or on my own. I still stay very active to this day, whether it's working out, going for runs or playing basketball with my friends, I love staying active still and keeping my body up to date.</p>
