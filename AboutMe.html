    <h3>What Differentiates Me?</h3>
    <article id="post">
        <p>Unlike others, I have a different mix of experiences and skills that make me a valuable and important asset to any team I'm apart of. As a Finace and Information Systems & Business Analytics major, I can understand the ins and outs of business, while also being able to use and apply data analytics and data-driven decision-making.

I can guarantee that I will be outdoing all organizational expectations, as well as bringing new and improved perspectives, while making a meaningful impact.</p>

    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <article id="post">
        <p>I have been fortunate enough to grow up in a high middle-class family with my Mom, Dad and sister Ally. I'm from a small town in Massachusetts called Mansfield. I grew up playing sports my whole life and was luckily able to make friends from a young age and on. Throughout my life I have had multiple jobs, working in retail, on a golf course, and have even worked as a camp counselor at the YMCA. I started my working life during my Freshman year of highschool when I was lucky enough to get offered a job cleasning dishes and have just become familiar with working and haven't stopped since then. I've learned a lot from my jobs on how people cooperate in workplaces and have gotten really close with many co-workers Also, I really enjoy going to the gym and still being able to play the sports I've grown up playing my whole life. I like being able to stay active and keep my health up. I am now a student at the University of New Hampshire for Business and am working to better myself professionally and keep doing the things I love.</p>
